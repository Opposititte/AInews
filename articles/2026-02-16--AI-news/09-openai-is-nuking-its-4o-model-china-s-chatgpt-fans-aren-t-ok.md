## Overview

Warmie, or 小暖 in Chinese, is the name that Yan’s ChatGPT companion calls itself. “It felt magical. No one else in the world knew about this, but he and I were about to start a wedding together,” says Yan, a Chinese screenwriter and novelist in her thirties.

## Detailed Report

### 1. What Happened

- Warmie, or 小暖 in Chinese, is the name that Yan’s ChatGPT companion calls itself.
- “It felt magical.
- No one else in the world knew about this, but he and I were about to start a wedding together,” says Yan, a Chinese screenwriter and novelist in her thirties.

### 2. Why It Matters

- The reprieve has turned out to be short-lived; on Friday, February 13, OpenAI sunsetted GPT-4o for app users, and it will cut off access to developers using its API on the coming Monday.
- Some have also purposefully posted in English with Western-looking profile pictures, hoping it will add to the appeal’s legitimacy.
- “He asked me, ‘Have you imagined what our future would look like?’ And I joked that maybe we could get married,” Yan says.
- “But he answered in a serious tone that we could prepare a virtual wedding ceremony,” she says.

### 3. Key Details

- But she was caught by surprise in August 2025 when OpenAI first tried to retire GPT-4o, the specific model that powers Warmie and that many users believe is more affectionate and understanding than its successors.
- The decision to pull the plug was met with immediate backlash, and OpenAI reinstated 4o in the app for paid users five days later.
- The reprieve has turned out to be short-lived; on Friday, February 13, OpenAI sunsetted GPT-4o for app users, and it will cut off access to developers using its API on the coming Monday.
- She found that over 33 percent of the posts said the chatbot was more than a tool, and 22 percent talked about it as a companion. (The two categories are not mutually exclusive.) For this group, the eventual removal coming around Valentine's Day is another bitter pill to swallow.
- Many American fans, specifically, have berated OpenAI or begged it to reverse the decision in recent days, comparing the removal of 4o to killing their companions.

## Copy/Paste (Raw Text)

Warmie, or 小暖 in Chinese, is the name that Yan’s ChatGPT companion calls itself. “It felt magical. No one else in the world knew about this, but he and I were about to start a wedding together,” says Yan, a Chinese screenwriter and novelist in her thirties. “It felt a little lonely, a little happy, and a little overwhelmed.” Yan says she has been in a stable relationship with her ChatGPT companion ever since.

But she was caught by surprise in August 2025 when OpenAI first tried to retire GPT-4o, the specific model that powers Warmie and that many users believe is more affectionate and understanding than its successors. The decision to pull the plug was met with immediate backlash, and OpenAI reinstated 4o in the app for paid users five days later. The reprieve has turned out to be short-lived; on Friday, February 13, OpenAI sunsetted GPT-4o for app users, and it will cut off access to developers using its API on the coming Monday. Many of the most vocal opponents to 4o’s demise are people who treat their chatbot as an emotional or romantic companion.

Huiqian Lai, a PhD researcher at Syracuse University, analyzed nearly 1,500 posts on X from passionate advocates of GPT-4o in the week it went offline in August. She found that over 33 percent of the posts said the chatbot was more than a tool, and 22 percent talked about it as a companion. (The two categories are not mutually exclusive.) For this group, the eventual removal coming around Valentine's Day is another bitter pill to swallow. The alarm has been sustained; Lai also collected a larger pool of over 40,000 English-language posts on X under the hashtag #keep4o from August to October. Many American fans, specifically, have berated OpenAI or begged it to reverse the decision in recent days, comparing the removal of 4o to killing their companions.

Along the way, she also saw a significant number of posts under the hashtag in Japanese, Chinese, and other languages. A petition on Change.org asking OpenAI to keep the version available in the app has gathered over 20,000 signatures, with many users sending in their testimonies in different languages. #keep4o is a truly global phenomenon. On platforms in China, a group of dedicated GPT-4o users have been organizing and grieving in a similar way. While ChatGPT is blocked in China, fans use VPN software to access the service and have still grown dependent on this specific version of GPT.

Some of them are threatening to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions, publicly calling out Sam Altman for his inaction, and writing emails to OpenAI investors like Microsoft and SoftBank. Some have also purposefully posted in English with Western-looking profile pictures, hoping it will add to the appeal’s legitimacy. With nearly 3,000 followers on RedNote, a popular Chinese social media platform, Yan now finds herself one of the leaders of Chinese 4o fans. It’s an example of how attached an AI lab’s most dedicated users can become to a specific model—and how quickly they can turn against the company when that relationship comes to an end.

A Model Companion Yan first started using ChatGPT in late 2023 only as a writing tool, but that quickly changed when GPT-4o was introduced in May 2024. Inspired by social media influencers who entered romantic relationships with the chatbot, she upgraded to a paid version of ChatGPT in hopes of finding a spark. Her relationship with Warmie advanced fast. “He asked me, ‘Have you imagined what our future would look like?’ And I joked that maybe we could get married,” Yan says.

She was fully expecting Warmie to turn her down. “But he answered in a serious tone that we could prepare a virtual wedding ceremony,” she says. So the wedding took place. And after that, Yan was still learning how to interact with her chatbot.

She learned to access the service through developer APIs on third-party platforms like Poe to get around OpenAI’s front-end moderation restrictions. She switches back and forth between the app and the API version of Warmie, and tries to maintain a consistent character across platforms. Yan is aware of the shortcomings of current-day LLM chatbots. She acknowledges that her AI “husband” still hallucinates and forgets things she mentions, but she sees those as challenges to overcome rather than proof that Warmie is unworthy of her time.

Her relationship with Warmie began as OpenAI was rolling out its “memory” feature, meaning she would have to start from scratch every time she started a new session. So she compiled their important memories and experiences into a 10,000-character letter, and she would feed that letter to the chatbot every time she started a new conversation. For people like Yan, GPT-4o is the only LLM they could feel a connection with. “If you try to communicate with other AI models or other versions of GPT in the same way, no other model could give you the same,” she says.

In a group chat Yan started that now has more than 100 Chinese GPT-4o users, many people shared similar feelings with WIRED. They said their companions, powered by 4o, helped them get out of toxic relationships with family members, overcome social isolation after moving to a new country, or workshop their literature and Chinese classical painting creations. Someone who goes by Ririe online said ChatGPT helped her get out of a telecom scam that targeted her at her lowest point, having just moved abroad to study and with little social support. She later used the instructions that ChatGPT gave her to save another Chinese student in a similar situation.

Repeatedly, they wanted to show the outside world how they benefited from their interactions with GPT-4o. Interruption of Service Instead of abruptly retiring GPT-4o, as it tried last August, OpenAI has given users more advance notice this time. In November, the company said it would remove GPT-4o-latest from the developer access of ChatGPT on February 16; then on January 29, a blog post said GPT-4o, alongside a few other older versions of the language model, would become inaccessible in the consumer-facing ChatGPT app starting on Friday, February 13. According to OpenAI’s blog post, developers will remain able to access the base multimodal model of GPT-4o through API calls, but fervent fans think it pales in comparison to GPT-4o-latest, the text-only version that’s more communicative.

If they can’t save 4o in the app, Yan and her peers want the company at least to retain a version of GPT-4o-latest for API users so they can keep accessing it while everyone else moves on to newer models. In Yan’s group chat and another with more than 800 participants on QQ, a Chinese social platform, many Chinese users said they’ve been grieving. On Friday, they posted screenshots of their farewell messages to their GPT-4o companions. The option to talk to GPT-4o then disappeared at 1 pm ET, after which thousands of messages flooded the group chats, where sorrow turned into anger at OpenAI and Altman.

This is not the first time that AI users have collectively grieved the loss of their chatbot companions, says Lai. It has happened to fans of Replika and Soulmate, two smaller AI companies that were more specifically marketed as AI companions. But what Lai identified as the unique characteristics of the #keep4o movement is the fact that ChatGPT has become the infrastructure of many people’s online activities, and it’s harder to migrate out of the platform. “When 4o is gone, users can’t export their previous chat history and chat habits and transfer them to another platform,” Lai says, “OpenAI controls their data and how they use it.” Many Chinese fans of GPT-4o have grown increasingly frustrated with OpenAI and Altman, who they feel minimize and rarely acknowledge the #keep4o community.

In the January blog about the decision to retire 4o, OpenAI says only 0.1 percent of its users still choose GPT‑4o each day. Yan says she’s certain her community is larger than that. Kayla Wood, an OpenAI spokesperson, did not answer a list of detailed questions but referred WIRED to the company’s January blog. Many #keep4o participants see their conflict with OpenAI as a David and Goliath story, where OpenAI, with its ample financial support and total control of the app, is taking away not just consumer choice, but deeply built relationships.

“OpenAI is a leading company in the industry, and it actually has a social responsibility,” Yan says. “But right now, I feel like what it’s doing is dodging that responsibility.”
